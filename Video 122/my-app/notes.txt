In Next.js we use server components by default which means the component passes through a server and the return statement renders the HTML code on the client side.

But any logic that we write inside our function and outside our return statement is treated as server logic.

Due to this we cannot use default react components like useState or useEffect unless me make our component a client component by using "use client"

We can also import a client component in our server component if we want to.
