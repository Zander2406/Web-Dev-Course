Helps web crawlers and other search engines to understand and parse our websites. We use specific tags in order for specific purposes instead of using more general tags. These are generally useful for SEO purposes.

General semantic tags:

header: usually contains the top section of a webpage with headings, navigation and logos

nav: contains the the navigation section of a webpage

article: indicates a self contained piece of content like a blog or an article

section: usually signifies a section of a webpage with similar content in it

aside: used for sidebars and content that is tangentially related to the main content

footer: is used for the footer of a wenpage containing copyright and contact details

figure & figcaption: used for embedding images and diagrams or charts with a caption

main: contains the main content of the website

time: it is used to display time related information

Why these are used?

These are beneficial for SEO purposes and to improve the readability of your code making it easier to maintain and access one example can be the dictation of webpages where we only want to read the main content instead of the whole webpage
