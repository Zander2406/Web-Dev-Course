In this we learn about Next auth to authenticate our apps. In order to to that we need to make a api/auth/[...nextauth] folder with routes file in it.

After that we need to import our auth providers in it.

Then we can go ahead and then we need to wrap our whole app in the authentication wrapper to use the session token through out the app.

We can store our authentication tokens in our .env file
