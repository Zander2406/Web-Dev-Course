In react we use the ternary operator or the logical and (&&) operator to implement if else statements.

For very small components we can also make them inside the App.jsx function itself. But we usually won't be doing that and making component jsx files.

We can integrate tailwind css with our Vite app to use tailwind classes as well.

While we are rendering components using map we also need to provide a unique key to our components so that they are rendered.
