We use flex box in the container that holds the items that we need to shift and not the items themselves

We can use the flexbox property to align our items horizontally and vertically, mostly flexbox is used to align our items in the center

The items in a flexbox do not lay left to right but they lay in the flex direction and we can change the flex direction for the container which will arrange our order accordingly

By default the flex direction is row

The direction in which the items are laying/flex direction is called our main axis and the direction which is perpendicular to our main axis is called cross axis

When we change our flex direction we change our axis as well

The justify-content works along the main axis and align-items works along the cross axis

The start and end of the main axis is called flex start and flex end

And similarly the start and end of the cross axis is called the cross start and cross end

The size along the main axis is main size and the size along the cross axis is cross size

Order can help us to lay items and the higher the order the later the item is and by default the order is 0

Flex grow helps us determine the size of an individual item flex grow is 0 by default

Flex shrink helps an item shrink faster relative to the other elements when the viewport shrinks

Align self is used to change the position of individual items
