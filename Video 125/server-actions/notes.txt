In Next.js we can use server actions to get server side work done.

In this example we tried submitting a form and to submit a form we need the server side to accept the POST data but we did not need to expose an endpoint of any API.

We can see that we can use specific funtions as well as server side components like used in the submit action function. We can have a client side app with a server side component.

But it is best practice to make sure our server actions are grouped together and in a single place instead of all over our frontend files. We can import the server side functions if necessary.

We also used useref in our frontend and to do that we specifically had to specify that this is a client component and not let the default server component loading happen to it.
