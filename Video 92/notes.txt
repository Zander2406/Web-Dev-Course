Here we are learning about ejs which is a template engine. Suppose we are making a blog and we want to keep the same format to show our blogs but every time we want a new blog the title, content and other variables will change. And to make that change happen we use template engines. EJS is a template engine.

We can fetch ejs to our packages using npm install ejs and use it with express

To use ejs we need to have ejs files in our views directory, ejs cannot use html files by themselves

The include function helps us make snippets that we can use in all our templates/views
