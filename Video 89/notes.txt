1. Handling POST and other requests
We can handle post requests in express like we handle get requests

2. Chaining requests
We can chain request types for a single path by writing them one after the after instead of writing them separately as well

3. Serving HTML files
We can serve HTML files by using the sendfile function of res and to serve the files we also need to give it a root or the absolute path

Different response methods in express are:
.download() - For downloading files
.end() - To end the response process
.json() - To send a json response
.jsonp() - To send a json with jsonp support
.redirect() - To redirect a request
.render() - To render a view template
.send() - To send responses of various types
.sendFile() - To send files as an octet stream
.sendStatus() - To set the response status code and send it's string representation as the response body

4. Installing Postman
Already installed, it is a tool to send different types of requests

5. Express Router
When we need to handle multiple different routes from a different base URL we can use this. We go ahead and define the urls in a different file and handle the different routes after that addition differently
