In this we will be looking at MongoDB. We can go ahead and install MongoDB Compass to interact with MongoDB in a easy manner but we can also use the shell in mongodb to write queries in it

show databases shows all our databases present

use database switches us to the database that we will use currently

To see all the documents we can use the db.collection.find() command to get all our documents in a course.
