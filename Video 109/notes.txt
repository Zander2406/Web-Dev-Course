So sometimes we need to create variables which can hold their values even after re-renders. Normally after each re-render (reload) the variables loose their values and are reset to their default values.

When we use useRef we do not trigger useEffect because it does not re-render the component. When we use useState we trigger the useEffect since we re-render components.

Basically useRef does not reload or render components like useState does.

We can also assign reference names to components in our DOM which we can call upon at any time of the program using ref

We should not be using ref in our DOM since it does not re-render the DOM so the value change won't be displayed. We use useState for it since it re-renders the DOM which can display the value.
