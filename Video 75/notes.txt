Javascript is an async language which means that the whole script will be executed first before the async functions are taken into account.

We can have callback funtions inside another callback function and doing it multiple times makes the code complex and hard to read/maintain. This is called a pyramid of doom. And this is why we use promises.

In prom1 we have made a promise that will resolve/end when the timeout function gets over. So with .then we take the value returned by the resolve and print it. And .catch to take the value for the reject.

In promises er pass 2 funtions, resolve and reject. We then use .then to capture the data returned by resolve and use .catch to capture the data returned by reject.
