In grid we can define the number of rows and columns

The space between any 2 grid lines is called grid track

Grid area is the area between 4 intersecting grid lines

We can place objects in a grid manually and even overlap items as well.

We can also configure the width of each row and column

In a grid we can number the grid lines either psitively going in the correct direction or number them negatively going in the reverse direction

We can also name the grid lines

For grid row and grid column attribute the syntax is grid row: start grid line/ end grid line; and the same will be followed for grid column as well

If we do not define a height or width then the items will stretch themselves to fit the grid cell automatically even if we assign a single item multiple cells

We can position objects in a grid using the grid lines and also by naming grid areas

fr is a unit in grids that takes a fraction of the available width

Justify content moves the whole grid itself and not just the items inside inside the container

place-content works for both justify content and align content
