Notes on hosting

We need computers to host our websites and we can get them from different vendors.
we can login to vps servers using our terminal to connct to the vps servers

We can use the command ssh root@ip_address to access the computer at that ip address as a root user.
We will need a password to access it which we will get if we buy our hosting.
Then we can use linux commands to navigate the terminal of the vps.

While making nodejs apps we should keep our files organized in directories where our routes, models, controllers are all bundled in a src folder which we can use to categorize our files efficiently

We should also use the dotenv package to configure our env variables
