When we use float if the image is not contained in the container then it overflows anyway and this can be solved using display flow-root property in the parent container

To specify any element which will not allow any element to float with it we can give it the property of clear (right, left or both)

Float and clear should be avoided unless compelled to use it since they are not very user friendly instead using flexbox will be a much better option
